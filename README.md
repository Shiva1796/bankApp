Frameworks used so far:
 - Express.js for Backend Structure
 - EJS for communicating variables with front end

Frameworks to be added in the future:
 - body-parser for customised links
 - passport for protecting passwords
 - mongoose for saving the users
 - dotenv for managing our passwords

When you pull those new files, cd to the working folder and run the code "NPM init" to install the two NPM modules added.

If you don't have NPM, let me know or google it.

When using EJS, we change the extension of .HTML to .EJS so the framework can read it (it will make sense in the future).

To run the page on your local drive, cd to the folder and type "node app.js" (or "nodemon app.js" if you are familiar with it), then on your browser type "http://localhost:3000/"
